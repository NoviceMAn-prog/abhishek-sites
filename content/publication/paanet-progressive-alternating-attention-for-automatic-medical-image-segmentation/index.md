abstract: Medical image segmentation can provide detailed information for
  clinical analysis which can be useful for scenarios where the detailed
  location of a finding is important. Knowing the location of a disease can play
  a vital role in treatment and decision-making. Convolutional neural network
  (CNN) based encoder-decoder techniques have advanced the performance of
  automated medical image segmentation systems. Several such CNN-based
  methodologies utilize techniques such as spatial- and channel-wise attention
  to enhance performance. Another technique that has drawn attention in recent
  years is residual dense blocks (RDBs). The successive convolutional layers in
  densely connected blocks are capable of extracting diverse features with
  varied receptive fields and thus, enhancing performance. However, consecutive
  stacked convolutional operators may not necessarily generate features that
  facilitate the identification of the target structures. In this paper, we
  propose a progressive alternating attention network (PAANet). We develop
  progressive alternating attention dense (PAAD) blocks, which construct a
  guiding attention map (GAM) after every convolutional layer in the dense
  blocks using features from all scales. The GAM allows the following layers in
  the dense blocks to focus on the spatial locations relevant to the target
  region. Every alternate PAAD block inverts the GAM to generate a reverse
  attention map which guides ensuing layers to extract boundary and edge-related
  information, refining the segmentation process.
