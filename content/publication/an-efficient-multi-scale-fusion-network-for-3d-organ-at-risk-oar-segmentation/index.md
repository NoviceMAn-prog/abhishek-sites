abstract: Accurate segmentation of organs-at-risks (OARs) is a precursor for
  optimizing radiation therapy planning. Existing deep learning-based
  multi-scale fusion architectures have demonstrated a tremendous capacity for
  2D medical image segmentation. The key to their success is aggregating global
  context and maintaining high resolution representations. However, when
  translated into 3D segmentation problems, existing multi-scale fusion
  architectures might underperform due to their heavy computation overhead and
  substantial data diet. To address this issue, we propose a new OAR
  segmentation framework, called OARFocalFuseNet, which fuses multi-scale
  features and employs focal modulation for capturing global-local context
  across multiple scales. Each resolution stream is enriched with features from
  different resolution scales, and multi-scale information is aggregated to
  model diverse contextual ranges. As a result, feature representations are
  further boosted.
