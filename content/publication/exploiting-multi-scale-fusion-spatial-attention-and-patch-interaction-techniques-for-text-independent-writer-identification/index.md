abstract: Text independent writer identification is a challenging problem that
  differentiates between different handwriting styles to decide the author of
  the handwritten text. Earlier writer identification relied on handcrafted
  features to reveal pieces of differences between writers. Recent work with the
  advent of convolutional neural network, deep learning-based methods have
  evolved. In this paper, three different deep learning techniques - spatial
  attention mechanism, multi-scale feature fusion and patch-based CNN were
  proposed to effectively capture the difference between each writer’s
  handwriting. Our methods are based on the hypothesis that handwritten text
  images have specific spatial regions which are more unique to a writer’s
  style, multi-scale features propagate characteristic features with respect to
  individual writers and patch-based features give more general and robust
  representations that helps to discriminate handwriting from different writers.
