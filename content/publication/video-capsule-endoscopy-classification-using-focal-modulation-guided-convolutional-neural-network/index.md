abstract: Video capsule endoscopy is a hot topic in computer vision and
  medicine. Deep learning can have a positive impact on the future of video
  capsule endoscopy technology. It can improve the anomaly detection rate,
  reduce physicians' time for screening, and aid in real-world clinical
  analysis. Computer-Aided diagnosis (CADx) classification system for video
  capsule endoscopy has shown a great promise for further improvement. For
  example, detection of cancerous polyp and bleeding can lead to swift medical
  response and improve the survival rate of the patients. To this end, an
  automated CADx system must have high throughput and decent accuracy. In this
  study, we propose FocalConvNet, a focal modulation network integrated with
  lightweight convolutional layers for the classification of small bowel
  anatomical landmarks and luminal findings. FocalCon-vNet leverages focal
  modulation to attain global context and allows global-local spatial
  interactions throughout the forward pass. Moreover, the convolutional block
  with its intrinsic induetive/learning bias and capacity to extract
  hierarchical features allows our FocalConvNet to achieve favourable results
  with high throughput.
