abstract: The detection and removal of precancerous polyps through colonoscopy
  is the primary technique for the prevention of colorectal cancer worldwide.
  However, the miss rate of colorectal polyp varies significantly among the
  endoscopists. It is well known that a computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system
  can assist endoscopists in detecting colon polyps and minimize the variation
  among endoscopists. In this study, we introduce a novel deep learning
  architecture, named MKDCNet, for automatic polyp segmentation robust to
  significant changes in polyp data distribution. MKDCNet is simply an
  encoder-decoder neural network that uses the pre-trained ResNet50 as the
  encoder and novel multiple kernel dilated convolution (MKDC) block that
  expands the field of view to learn more robust and heterogeneous
  representation. Extensive experiments on four publicly available polyp
  datasets and cell nuclei dataset show that the proposed MKDCNet outperforms
  the state-of-the-art methods when trained and tested on the same dataset as
  well when tested on unseen polyp datasets from different distributions. With
  rich results, we demonstrated the robustness of the proposed architecture.
  From an efficiency perspective, our algorithm can process at ( â‰ˆ45 ) frames
  per second on RTX 3090 GPU.
