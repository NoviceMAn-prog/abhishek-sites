abstract: "The performance of facial super-resolution methods relies on their
  ability to recover facial structures and salient features effectively. Even
  though the convolutional neural network and generative adversarial
  network-based methods deliver impressive performances on face hallucination
  tasks, the ability to use attributes associated with the low-resolution images
  to improve performance is unsatisfactory. In this paper, we propose an
  Attribute Guided Attention Generative Adversarial Network which employs novel
  attribute guided attention (AGA) modules to identify and focus the generation
  process on various facial features in the image. Stacking multiple AGA modules
  enables the recovery of both high and low-level facial structures. We design
  the discriminator to learn discriminative features by exploiting the
  relationship between the high-resolution image and their corresponding facial
  attribute annotations. We then explore the use of U-Net based architecture to
  refine existing predictions and synthesize further facial details. "
