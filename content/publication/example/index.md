abstract: Methods based on convolutional neural networks have improved the
  performance of biomedical image segmentation. However, most of these methods
  cannot efficiently segment objects of variable sizes and train on small and
  biased datasets, which are common for biomedical use cases. While methods
  exist that incorporate multi-scale fusion approaches to address the challenges
  arising with variable sizes, they usually use complex models that are more
  suitable for general semantic segmentation problems. In this paper, we propose
  a novel architecture called Multi-Scale Residual Fusion Network (MSRF-Net),
  which is specially designed for medical image segmentation. The proposed
  MSRF-Net is able to exchange multi-scale features of varying receptive fields
  using a Dual-Scale Dense Fusion (DSDF) block. Our DSDF block can exchange
  information rigorously across two different resolution scales, and our MSRF
  sub-network uses multiple DSDF blocks in sequence to perform multi-scale
  fusion.
