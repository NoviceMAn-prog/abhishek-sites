abstract: Efforts have been made to automate the detection and segmentation of
  polyps, a precancerous precursor, to effectively minimize missed rate. Widely
  used computer-aided polyp segmentation systems actuated by encoder-decoder
  have achieved high performance in terms of accuracy. However, polyp
  segmentation datasets collected from varied centers can follow different
  imaging protocols leading to difference in data distribution. As a result,
  most methods suffer from performance drop and require re-training for each
  specific dataset. We address this generalizability issue by proposing a global
  multi-scale residual fusion network (GMSRF-Net). Our proposed network
  maintains high-resolution representations while performing multi-scale fusion
  operations for all resolution scales. To further leverage scale information,
  we design cross multi-scale attention (CMSA) and multi-scale feature selection
  (MSFS) modules within the GMSRF-Net. The repeated fusion operations gated by
  CMSA and MSFS demonstrate improved generalizability of the network.
