abstract: Colorectal cancer is one of the major cause of cancer-related death
  around the world. High-quality colonoscopy is considered mandatory for
  resecting and preventing colorectal cancers. In the recent past, various
  technological advances have been made towards improving the quality of
  colonoscopy. Despite the technical advancement, some polyps are frequently
  missed during colonoscopy examinations. Polyp detection (for example,
  adenomas) rates are largely influenced by inter-endoscopist variability.
  Therefore, it is very challenging to standardize a high-quality colonoscopy. A
  computeraided detection system could solve the problem with miss-detection.
  The “MediaEval 2021” challenge entails the chance to study and develop
  accurate automated polyp segmentation algorithms [6]. In this paper, we
  propose our approach based on MSRFNet. Our experimental findings show that the
  model trained on the Kvasir-SEG dataset and evaluated on a competition test
  dataset obtains a dice coefficient of 0.7055, Jaccard of 0.6176, a recall of
  0.7293, and a precision of 0.7769.
