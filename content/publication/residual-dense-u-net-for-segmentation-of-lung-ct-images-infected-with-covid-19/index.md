abstract: The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) has been declared as a
  pandemic by the World Health Organization which in the current global scenario
  has brought everything from economy to education to a halt. Due to its rapid
  spread around the globe, even the most developed countries are facing
  difficulties in diagnosing Covid-19. For efficient treatment and quarantining
  of the exposed population it is important to analyse Lung CT Scans of the
  suspected Covid-19 patients. Computer aided segmentation of the suspicious
  Region of Interest can be used for better characterization of infected regions
  in Lung. In this work a deep learning-based U-Net architecture is proposed as
  a framework for automated segmentation of multiple suspicious regions in a CT
  scan of Covid-19 patient. Advantage of Dense Residual Connections has been
  taken to learn the global hierarchical features from all convolutionâ€™s layers.
  So, a better trade-off in between efficiency and effectiveness in a U-Net can
  be maintained.
