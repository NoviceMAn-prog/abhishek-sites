I am a Post Baccalaureate Research Fellow at the Machine and Hybrid Intelligence Lab, Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University. Currently I am working on Uncertainty Estimation and Domain Generalization under the Supervision of [Dr. Ulas Bagci](https://sites.northwestern.edu/bagci/). Prior to this I spent two wonderful year working in the Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Unit, Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata under the supervision of [Dr Umapada Pal](https://www.isical.ac.in/~umapada/) and [Dr Sukalpa Chanda](https://www.hiof.no/iio/itk/english/people/aca/sukalpac/index.html). At ISI, I worked on several different projects in the field of Medical Image Analysis, Writer Indentification and Face Super-resolution. Moreover, I was responsible for the development of a remote vital estimation system funded by [BabySensor, Norway](https://babysensor.com/). I completed my Bachelor of Technology with Honors in Computer Science and Engineering from Jaypee Institute of Information Technology in 2021.
